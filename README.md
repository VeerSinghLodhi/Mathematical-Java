# Mathematical-Java

Iâ€™ve been working on a Java-based Mathematics Application using the Multiple Document Interface (MDI) concept. designed to simplify complex calculations and provide an interactive platform for mathematical exploration.



âœ¨ Key Highlights:

ðŸŒŸ Core Features: Covers basic arithmetic, advanced algebra, calculus, and matrix operations.

ðŸ’» Tech Stack: Developed entirely in Java with efficient algorithms for faster computations.

ðŸŽ¨ User-Friendly Interface: Designed with simplicity and usability in mind.

ðŸ“ˆ Real-World Applications: Helps students, educators, and enthusiasts solve problems efficiently.

This project gave me an excellent opportunity to strengthen my programming skills while addressing practical mathematical challenges. Itâ€™s a step forward in integrating my passion for coding and problem-solving.
